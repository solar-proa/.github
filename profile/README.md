# Solar Proa

The solar proa is a novel boat design for carbon-neutral small-scale tropical maritime transport, exploration, and tourism. These boats combine traditional Southeast Asian and Polynesian boat designs and rigs with solar power and modern materials. More on solar proas is available at the website [https://solarproa.org](https://solarproa.org) generated by the repo [CAD](https://github.com/solar-proa/CAD).
